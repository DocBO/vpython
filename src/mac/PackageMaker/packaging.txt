Instructions for creating a Mac installer.

To use the Apple Package Maker (that comes with XCode) to create an
installer, create a folder named "stage" at the same level as
vpython-wx, for assembling an installer for Python 2

Place directories in stage as shown:

../vpy-stage/VIdle:
drwxrwxr-x  3 root   admin  102 Jan 10 05:41 VIDLE-Py2.7.app

../vpy-stage/site-packages:
drwxrwxr-x  4 root   admin  136 Jan  6 09:59 Font Tools
drwxrwxr-x  4 root   admin  136 Jan  5 05:20 Polygon
drwxrwxr-x  4 root   admin  136 Jan  5 05:21 TTF Query
drwxrwxr-x  4 root   admin  136 Jan 12 16:58 Visual Extension
drwxrwxr-x  4 root   admin  136 Jan  7 20:44 numpy
drwxrwxr-x  3 root   admin  102 Jan  8 14:17 wx-redirect

../vpy-stage/wx-libraries:
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root   admin   16 Jan  7 20:00 wxPython -> wxPython-2.9.4.0
drwxr-xr-x  6 root   wheel  204 Jul 21 15:26 wxPython-2.9.4.0

../vpy-stage/site-packages/Font Tools:
drwxrwxr-x  8 root  admin  272 Jan  6 09:55 FontTools
-rw-rw-r--  1 root  admin   10 Jan  6 09:55 FontTools.pth

../vpy-stage/site-packages/Polygon:
drwxrwxr-x  11 root  admin   374 Jan  5 05:20 Polygon
-rw-rw-r--   1 root  admin  2575 Jan  5 05:20 Polygon-2.0.1-py2.7.egg-info

../vpy-stage/site-packages/TTF Query:
-rw-rw-r--   1 root  admin  1654 Jan  5 05:20 TTFQuery-1.0.4-py2.7.egg-info
drwxrwxr-x  24 root  admin   816 Jan  5 05:20 ttfquery

../vpy-stage/site-packages/Visual Extension:
drwxrwxr-x  7 root  admin  238 Jan 12 16:58 VPython-6.01-py2.7-macosx-10.6-intel.egg
-rw-rw-r--  1 root  admin   43 Jan 13 13:12 VPython.pth

../vpy-stage/site-packages/numpy:
drwxr-xr-x  38 root  admin  1292 Jan  7 20:42 numpy
-rw-r--r--   1 root  admin  1658 Jan  7 20:43 numpy-1.6.1-py2.7.egg-info

../vpy-stage/site-packages/wx-redirect:
-rw-rw-r--  1 root  admin   78 Jan  8 10:16 wxredirect.pth

If the version of any of the 3rd party packages changes just
delete the sub-package from the document and drag the appropriate
folder from the stage directory into the Package Maker document.
Under the Configuration menu -> Install should be "relative" and
Destination should be "chosen" to be the site-packages folder.

The VPython.app is a bundle (unzip from src/mac/PackageMaker/VIDLE_launcher.zip)

Clean out irrelevant files from these folders (e.g. CVS folders, make files).

(Historical Note: The VIDLE launcher was created starting from the
IDLE launcher found in the /Applications/Python X.Y folder. Make a
copy of this IDLE launcher. If you right-click (ctrl-click) IDLE, you
can gain access to the contents of what is actually a folder. The
Python script Resources/idlemain.py was edited with TextEdit to change
idlelib.PyShell to vidle.PyShell. Doubleclick info.plist to use the
plist editor to change IDLE to VIDLE in "Executable file", "Bundle
identifier", and "Bundle name". Change the name of MacOS/IDLE to
MacOS/VIDLE. You don't need to change IDLE to VIDLE in the icon file
names (*.icns). Finally, change the name of the IDLE launcher to
VIDLE.)

Use the python setup.py script to update the VPython egg directory
when there are updates. If the version number is changed VPython.pth
will have to be edited. The setup.py script should be edited to use
the new version number. When run, it will include the new egg
directory in the easy_install.pth. This should be removed and the
VPython.pth file should be edited to reflect the new version number.

Once this is done there is a "helper" script:

src/mac/PackageMaker/copyFromInstalled.py

That will automatically copy the egg/pth structure from the
site-packages directory to the staging area. You should edit the paths
to match the new version numbers etc. This script needs to be run from
the vpython-wx directory.

Now go to PackageMaker folder and doubleclick the package maker document.

Choose Project > Install Properties to specify the minimum operating system required.

For the VPython folder component click the folder in the left panel.
Highlight the Configuration tab and set the destination to
/Applications/VPython-PyX.Y (e.g. /Applications/VPython-Py2.7).

Next, highlight the Components tab. IMPORTANT: Make sure that Allow
Relocation for VIDLE.app is NOT checked. This must be every time you
build the installer; the setting is not saved. (Actually it seems to
be saved sometimes, but best to check anyway)

Now you can save the package maker document and/or build the installer.

There is also now an experimental command line script in the PackageMaker
directory that will build the package and the .dmg. You may need to
edit the paths to match your setup/version of Xcode.

sh src/mac/PackageMaker/buildPackage.sh pkg

will build the package

sh src/mac/PackageMaker/buildPackage.sh dmg

will build the dmg file for distribution.
